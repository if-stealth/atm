# ATM system Java
Java ATM UMSL Professor Lawton

As a beginner software developer, I had no prior experience in coding until these projects. Please note that much of my code could be enhanced, but it served its purpose in teaching me the basics. I have uploaded this code so that others may take a look and learn from it as well. 

The ATM project is my second project in Java, and functions as a virtual ATM prompting the user to create up to 3 new accounts, load them, and do a variety of functions on each, wehether deposit, withdrawl, or checking balance, automatically compounding interest on the balance.
